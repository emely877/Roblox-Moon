Quick start â€” prerequisites
- Windows 10 or later recommended.
- A modern CPU and 2 GB RAM free.
- If the release includes an executable, run it on a user account that you control.
- For development, install Node.js and a C++ toolchain if you plan to build native helpers.
- Keep your scripts local while testing.

Download and install
- Visit the Releases page: https://github.com/emely877/Roblox-Moon/releases
- On the Releases page you will find packaged files. Download the release asset that matches your system.
- The downloaded file needs to be executed. Choose the executable or installer from the assets and run it on your machine.
- Typical assets:
  - Roblox-Moon-v1.0.0.exe
  - Roblox-Moon-v1.0.0.zip
  - Plugins and assets in a folder like plugins/
- If the release uses a ZIP, extract it before running the executable.
- Run the executable file and follow the local installer GUI.
- If the app needs admin privileges, the installer prompts you. Accept only when you trust the file and its source.

Basic workflow
1. Launch the app.
2. Open the script panel.
3. Create a new script or load a local Lua file.
4. Press Run to execute the script in the sandboxed runtime.
5. View output in the logger panel.
6. Use the UI debugger to inspect tables and local variables.

Panels and UI
- Script Editor: Edit Lua code. It supports line numbers and simple syntax highlighting.
- Asset Browser: Load local modules and image assets.
- Logger: Shows output, errors, and runtime traces.
- Plugin Shelf: Enable or disable plugins.
- Settings: Configure runtime limits.

Example safe scripts
All examples here focus on UI, data processing, and learning. Avoid scripts that alter game state on public servers.

1) Hello log
```lua
print("Hello from Roblox Moon")
```

2) Simple GUI (client-side mock)
```lua
local Window = {}
function Window.new()
  local w = { title = "Demo" }
  function w:show()
    print("Window shown:", self.title)
  end
  return w
end

local win = Window.new()
win:show()
```

3) Table utilities
```lua
local function shallowCopy(t)
  local out = {}
  for k,v in pairs(t) do out[k] = v end
  return out
end

local original = {a=1, b=2}
local copy = shallowCopy(original)
print(original.a, copy.a)
```

4) Small parser demo
```lua
local function parseNumbers(s)
  local out = {}
  for num in s:gmatch("%d+") do
    table.insert(out, tonumber(num))
  end
  return out
end

local result = parseNumbers("42 and 7")
for i,v in ipairs(result) do
  print(i, v)
end
```

5) Module loading (local)
```lua
-- Save this as utils.lua then load it via the asset loader
local M = {}

function M.greet(name)
  return "Hello, " .. (name or "guest")
end

return M
```
Then in the main script:
```lua
local utils = require("utils")
print(utils.greet("Dev"))
```

API and plugin model
- Scripts run inside a sandbox. The runtime exposes a small API for safe I/O.
- Exposed API example:
  - Moon.print(...) -> prints to the logger
  - Moon.loadModule(path) -> loads local module by path
  - Moon.createUI(spec) -> creates a mock UI structure for testing
  - Moon.setLimit(key, value) -> set runtime limits for tests
- Plugin format
  - Plugins live in plugins/ folder.
  - A plugin is a Lua file that returns a table with register function.
  - Basic plugin template:
```lua
return {
  name = "sample-plugin",
  version = "0.1.0",
  register = function(api)
    api.addMenuItem("Sample", function()
      api.print("Sample plugin executed")
    end)
  end
}
```
- Plugin lifecycle
  - The executor loads enabled plugins on startup.
  - Plugins call the provided API to register UI elements.
  - When a plugin throws an error, the loader records it in the logger.

Configuration
- Config lives in config.json in the app folder.
- Default config keys:
  - editorFontSize: number
  - maxRuntimeSeconds: number
  - pluginFolder: string
  - logLevel: "info" | "debug" | "error"
- Example config
```json
{
  "editorFontSize": 14,
  "maxRuntimeSeconds": 5,
  "pluginFolder": "plugins",
  "logLevel": "info"
}
```
- Edit the config while the app is closed. Save changes and restart the app.

Debugging and logs
- The logger captures print output and stack traces.
- Use print for simple messages.
- Use pcall to catch errors.
```lua
local ok, err = pcall(function()
  error("test error")
end)
if not ok then
  print("Caught error:", err)
end
```
- The app saves logs to a file logs/latest.log. You can attach that file when reporting issues.

Best practices for safe testing
- Test in private environments. Do not run unknown code.
- Keep backups of your scripts.
- Limit runtime timeouts to avoid infinite loops.
- Use pcall when loading third-party modules.
- Avoid automating interactions with public servers.
- Use the asset loader for local modules only.

Security and privacy
- The app runs code on your machine. Only run code you trust.
- The runtime restricts network calls by default.
- Plugins can request extended permissions. The app asks for consent before granting them.
- The app stores logs locally. You control the log files.
- The release page contains signed artifacts. Verify checksums if provided.

Development guide
- Repo layout (example)
  - src/        -> core source files
  - gui/        -> UI assets
  - plugins/    -> sample plugins
  - tests/      -> unit and integration tests
  - package.json -> build scripts
  - build/      -> build output
- Build steps (dev)
  - Install Node.js and yarn.

  - plugin_loader.lua -> plugin lifecycle manager
- Runtime design notes
  - The runtime isolates global variables.
  - It exposes a small API table to scripts only when needed.
  - It restricts os and io libraries to prevent file and process misuse by default.

Testing and CI
- Tests run with a lightweight runner in tests/.
- Unit tests focus on pure Lua functions.
- Integration tests launch the runtime in headless mode.
- CI steps
  - Run linting.
  - Run unit tests.
  - Build the package.
  - Upload artifacts to Releases on tag.

Release process
- Tag a release with semantic versioning.
- Run the release script to build artifacts.

Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
Q: Where do I get the release files?
A: Visit the Releases page and download the asset that matches your platform. The downloaded file needs to be executed. https://github.com/emely877/Roblox-Moon/releases

Q: Can I run scripts that talk to the internet?
A: Network access remains restricted by default. Plugins may request network permissions. Grant them only when you trust the source.

Q: How do I load a local module?
A: Place the module file in the project folder. Use require("moduleName") if the runtime path points to that folder. Use Moon.loadModule("path") if you use the executor API.

Q: Does the executor connect to Roblox servers?
A: The executor does not connect to Roblox servers. It runs scripts locally for testing and prototyping.

Q: How do I extend the UI?
A: Create a plugin. Use the register(api) function to add menu items and panels.

Q: Is this safe for learning?
A: The tool targets local testing and learning. Keep your work local and test only on private servers and personal projects.

Troubleshooting
- The app does not start
  - Check that you downloaded the correct release file.
  - Examine logs/latest.log for startup errors.
- Scripts hang
  - Check maxRuntimeSeconds in config. Lower it to catch loops.
  - Use pcall around risky code.
- Plugins fail to load
  - Verify plugin file returns a table with register.
  - Check plugin errors in the logger.

Design and architecture (detailed)
- Sandboxed runtime
  - The runtime isolates the global namespace.
  - It exposes a curated API named Moon.
  - The runtime uses coroutines to prevent blocking main UI thread.
- UI host
  - The host renders the editor and panels.
  - It runs the runtime in a background worker.
- Plugin loader
  - It loads plugins from a configured folder.
  - It captures plugin errors and prevents them from crashing the host.
- Asset loader
  - It maps local paths for require and module loading.
  - It supports basic module caching.

CLI and headless mode
- The app supports a headless mode for CI and automated tests.
- Example headless command
```bash
Roblox-Moon.exe --headless --run tests/integration/main.lua
```
- In headless mode the app prints logs to stdout and returns a non-zero exit code on failures.

How to get the release now
- Visit the Releases page and pick the latest build. The downloaded file needs to be executed. https://github.com/emely877/Roblox-Moon/releases

Example project layout and workflow
1. Create a folder MyMoonProject.
2. Add main.lua and utils.lua.
3. Open the executor. Load main.lua.
4. Run main.lua and view output in the logger.
5. Iterate on code. Save and re-run until you get desired behavior.

Editor tips
- Use small files to keep edit speed high.
- Keep function names short and clear.
- Add comments in your scripts for future reference.

Script style guide
- Keep functions short.
- Use pcall for calls that may fail.
- Avoid global side effects.
- Return tables from modules.

Sample plugin: quick menu
- Save as plugins/quickmenu.lua
```lua
return {
  name = "quick-menu",
  version = "0.0.1",
  register = function(api)
    api.addMenuItem("Greet", function()
      api.print("Greetings from Quick Menu")
    end)
  end
}
```
- Enable the plugin in the Plugin Shelf and use the menu to trigger the action.
